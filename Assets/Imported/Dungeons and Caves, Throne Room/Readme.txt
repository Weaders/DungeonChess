For a correct visualization of the scene, you have to import a custom package called
"Effects" in "Assets/Import Package/Effects" and add the next scripts to the main camera:

- Screen Space Ambient Occlusion
- Depth of Field
- Antialiasing
- Bloom

You can see the parameters that I used in the file "Parameters.png" in the root of this
project (Same folder like this "readme")
